1. ArrayList uses dynamic Array to store the elements.LinkedList internally uses doublyLinkedList to store the elements

2. Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed, bit shifting is required in memory
   location. Manipulation with linked list is faster as it uses doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
 
3. Arraylist class can only act as a list as it only implements list but Linkedlist can act as both list and queue as
   it implements List and Dqueue interfaces.

4. Arraylist is better in storing and  accessing data. Linked List is better in manipulating data.

---------------------------------
Iterator Vs ListIterator
1. Iterator can be used by different interfaces like Set, List, Map but ListIterator can only be used by LIST interface(ArrayList, Linked List)
2. Iterator can be used only for forward traversing but ListIterator can be used for forward and backward both direction traversing.
3. Iterator can be used only to remove the elements  but Listerator is used to add, remove, set the elements.
4. Using iterator we can traverse only from starting postion of the collection but Listiterator is used to traverse from any position of the list.
