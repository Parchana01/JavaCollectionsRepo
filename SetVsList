1)List is an ordered collection it maintains the insertion order, which means upon displaying the list content will display 
the elements in the same  order in which they got inserted into the list.
Set is an unordered collection, it doesn't maintain any order. Only LinkedHashSet maintains the elements in 
insertion order.

2)List allows duplicate elements but set dosen't allow any duplicate elements.
If we try to insert any duplicate elements in set it will replace the existing value.

3)List Implementations: LinkedList,ArrayList
  Set Implementations: Hashset, LinkedHashset,TreeSet
 
4)List allows multiple null values but Set allows single null value atmost.

5)ListIterator used to traverse List both backward and forward.Iterator is used to traverse a set.

6)List Interface has one legacy class called Vedtor class but Set doesn't have any legacy classes.

Legacy Class:
--------------
What are the Legacy classes in Java?
Dictionary
Properties
HashTable
Vector
Stack
Legacy Interface
Enumeration

Earlier versions of Java did not include the Collections Framework. Only in from version 1.2, 
you could actually use this Legacy class. In this,  the original classes were reengineered to 
support the collection interface. These classes are also known as Legacy classes. 
All legacy classes and interfaces were redesigned by JDK 5 to support Generics.
